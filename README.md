   “The Warmish Frog” is a 2D Top-Down puzzle RPG in the style of beloved franchises from the late 90s to early 2000s. The story follows the main character’s journey to retrieve their lost blanket in order to beat the evil villain and win the game. This paper will highlight the development process for the game “The Warmish Frog”. Starting with the initial project objectives, it will discuss building a four-way movement system for a fully functional character and a completely operational GUI (Graphic User Interface), showcasing the project details in Unity in a 2D format, and what the initial ambitions for this project were. Then, the important considerations that need to be taken during the development of a video game are discussed, making reference to the legal, social, and ethical issues involved. The management process of this product and how it was organized to facilitate a smooth workflow are detailed using a GANTT chart, a Trello board, and a comprehensive risk assessment. Next, we review the design choices and research that went into making the game’s aesthetic and artistic style for the game, reflecting upon inspiration from other games for the character and level designs. Finally, the culmination of all of this work is shown in the implementation section, where ideas became code and code became “The Warmish Frog”.
